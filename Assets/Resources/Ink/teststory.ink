VAR player = ""
VAR ally = ""

This is a test story.
This is a second line in the test story. What happens to the renderer if I end up making this sentence quite long? How about super long?
I like this story. Third line btw.
* [Option A]{player} chose option A.
    "The fool chose option A!"
* [Option B]You chose option B.
    "The fool chose option B!"
